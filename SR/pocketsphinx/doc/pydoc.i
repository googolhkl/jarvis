Acoustic model structure.

This object encapsulates all stages of acoustic processing, from raw
audio input to acoustic score output. The reason for grouping all of
these modules together is that they all have to \"agree\" in their
parameterizations, and the configuration of the acoustic and dynamic
feature computation is completely dependent on the parameters used to
build the original acoustic model (which should by now always be
specified in a feat.params file).

Because there is not a one-to-one correspondence from blocks of input
audio or frames of input features to frames of acoustic scores (due to
dynamic feature calculation), results may not be immediately available
after input, and the output results will not correspond to the last
piece of data input.

TODO: In addition, this structure serves the purpose of queueing
frames of features (and potentially also scores in the future) for
asynchronous passes of recognition operating in parallel.

the grammar.

String containing best hypothesis at this point in decoding. NULL if
no hypothesis is available. ";

%feature("docstring")  Decoder::get_prob "

Get posterior probability.

Unless the -bestpath option is enabled, this function will always
return zero (corresponding to a posterior probability of 1.0). Even if
-bestpath is enabled, it will also return zero when called on a
partial result. Ongoing research into effective confidence annotation
for partial hypotheses may result in these restrictions being lifted
in future versions.

Parameters:
-----------

ps:  Decoder.

Posterior probability of the best hypothesis. ";

Get an iterator over the word segmentation for the best hypothesis.

last frame in which the given word or other segment was active.
Therefore, the actual duration is *out_ef - *out_sf + 1.

Parameters:
-----------

seg:  Segment iterator.

out_sf:  Output: First frame index in segment.

%feature("docstring")  Segment::prob "

Get language, acoustic, and posterior probabilities from a
segmentation iterator.

Unless the -bestpath option is enabled, this function will always

partial result. Ongoing research into effective confidence annotation
for partial hypotheses may result in these restrictions being lifted
in future versions.

Parameters:
-----------

out_ascr:  Output: acoustic model score for this segment.

out_lscr:  Output: language model score for this segment.

out_lback:  Output: language model backoff mode for this segment (i.e.

should not attempt to free it manually. It is only valid until the
next utterance, unless you use ps_lattice_retain() to retain it. ";

%feature("docstring")  Decoder::nbest "

Get an iterator over the best hypotheses, optionally within a selected
region of the utterance.

Iterator is empty now, it must be advanced with ps_nbest_next first.

features.

multiple traversals are possible at once, no separate iterator
structure is provided.

%feature("docstring")  fast_logmath_add "

Quickly log-add two negated log probabilities.

Parameters:
-----------

lmath:  The log-math object

mlx:  A negative log probability (0 < mlx < 255)

mly:  A negative log probability (0 < mly < 255)

-log(exp(-mlx)+exp(-mly))  We can do some extra-fast log addition
since we know that mixw+ascr is always less than 256 and hence x-y is
also always less than 256. This relies on some cooperation from
logmath_t which will never produce a logmath table smaller than 256
entries.

Note that the parameters are negated log probabilities (and hence, are
positive numbers), as is the return value. This is the key to the
\"fastness\" of this function. ";
